# @simondotm/nx-firebase Changelog

* **Nx badges** for each release indicate the Nx version the plugin was built against, and the minimum required version of Nx to use the plugin. Each plugin release may be with earlier or future versions of Nx, but this is not always guaranteed.

* **Node badges** for each release indicate the Node version the plugin was built against, and the default engine set for Firebase functions generated by the plugin, not the node version required to use the plugin.

This plugin was completely rewritten since V2.x to use esbuild for bundling cloud functions. For documentation of the legacy v1.x plugin version see [here](https://github.com/simondotm/nx-firebase/tree/release/v1.1.0).

Users of earlier plugin versions must read [here for plugin v1 -> v2 migration instructions](docs/nx-firebase-migrations.md#migration-from-plugin-v1x-to-v200)

> **Please note that legacy v1 versions of the plugin are no longer supported from this point on, so only take this update if you are prepared to migrate your workspace and Firebase projects**

# Version 1

## v1.1.0 ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nx-v16.1.1-blue) ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node-v16-orange)

No changes from beta.

## v1.1.0-beta.0 ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nx-v16.1.1-blue) ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node-v16-orange)

Updated for Nx 16.1.1+

- You will need to migrate your workspace to Nx 16.1.1 before updating the plugin

## v1.0.0 ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nx-v13.10.6-blue) ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node-v16-orange)

First Major release. No change since `0.13.0-beta.1`.

Compatible with Nx 13.10.6+

## v0.13.0-beta.1 ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nx-v13.10.6-blue) ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node-v16-orange)

**Changes**

- `main` removed from template `package.json` for firebase app generator - this is automatically set by the builder
- Support `nx watch` in compatible Nx workspace hosts
- Support `nx:run-commands` in compatible Nx workspace hosts
- Various small fixes

**Migration Guide**

- Check the [targets documentation](docs/nx-firebase-targets.md) if you already have a workspace that is using nx-firebase
- Remove `main` from `package.json` files in any nx-firebase apps in your workspace

## v0.13.0-beta.0 ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nx-v13.10.6-blue) ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node-v16-orange)

Due to the large number of API changes in Nx from version 12 to version 13.10, this plugin has been rewritten from scratch:

- **Improved compatibility**
  - To support the latest Nx devkit API's for plugins
- **Refactored build process**
  - `build` executor is now entirely based on the `@nrwl/js:tsc` executor, which simplifies maintenance of the plugin
  - this also enables `--watch` to work
  - _(note that changes to Nx library dependencies are still not yet detectable in `--watch` mode)_
- **Functions Node engine**
  - Plugin now defaults to Node 16 runtime engine for firebase functions
- **Improved Firebase configurations**
  - `nx g @simondotm/nx-firebase:app` will now generate a `firebase.json` configuration file for the **first** firebase application in the Nx workspace. Additional generated firebase applications will have a firebase configuration named `firebase.project-name.json`
- **Project Alias Support**
  - If you already know the firebase project alias you are using for your application, you can now use the `--project` generator parameter to set this in the project targets eg. `nx g @simondotm/nx-firebase:app appname --project=firebaseprojectalias`
- **Additional dependencies**
  - `nx g @simondotm/nx-firebase:app` will add firebase and [`kill-port`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kill-port) dependencies
  - `kill-port` is used by the `serve` and `emulate` targets to ensure clean startup.
- **Documentation has been updated**

Recommended minimum version of Nx is now 13.10.6. See [Nx Migration](docs/nx-migration.md) documentation for more information.

## v0.3.13 ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nx-v13.2.3-blue) ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node-v12-orange)



## v0.3.4 ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nx-v13.2.3-blue) ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node-v12-orange)

Interim release fixes for issues introduced in nx version 13.0.2+ where `createProjectGraph` was deprecated.

As of Nx v13.10.x, `copyAssets` was also broken in v0.3.4 of the plugin, but now fixed thanks to contributors.

**Migration Recommendations**

If you are running on older versions of Nx, the following information may be useful:

**No more `--with-deps`**

From Nx version 12.3+, Nx now automatically checks for & builds required dependencies when running build targets.

Therefore `--with-deps` is deprecated, so this parameter can be removed from any firebase Nx application targets such as `build`, `serve`, `deploy`, `configuration`, and also in the functions `predeploy` setting within any `firebase.<project>.json` configuration files you may have.

**No more `--parallel`**

Same applies for `--parallel` since this is now a default setting in `nx.json`

It may be necessary to pass `--parallel=3` in CI scripts however.

**Nx command syntax**

It may also be worth updating commands within any firebase application targets of the format:

- `nx run project:build` to the newer
- `nx build project` syntax

**Update executors**

As of Nx 13.8.8, `@nrwl/node:package` is replaced by `@nrwl/js:tsc`.

Nx version migrations below may handle this transition for you, but if not, you may need to update your `build` targets for imported libraries accordingly to build with `@nrwl/js:tsc`.

See [Nx Migration](docs/nx-migration.md) documentation for more information.

## v0.3.3 ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nx-v12.3.4-blue) ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node-v12-orange)

**General changes**

- Improved listing of firebase functions dependencies; now ordered by npm module libraries first, then local libraries, sorted alphabetically.

**Enhanced Support for Firebase Emulators**

`nx g @simondotm/nx-firebase:app` generator now additionally:

- Adds default `auth` and `pubsub` settings to `"emulators": {...}` config in `firebase.<appname>.json` so that these services are also emulated by default.

- Adds a new `getconfig` target to firebase functions app, where:

  - `nx getconfig <firebaseappname>` will fetch the [functions configuration variables](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/local-emulator#set_up_functions_configuration_optional) from the server and store it locally as `.runtimeconfig.json`

- Adds `.runtimeconfig.json` to asset list to be copied (if it exists) from app directory to output `dist` directory when built, so that the function emulators will now run if the functions being emulated access variables from the functions config.

- Adds `.runtimeconfig.json` to the Nx workspace root `.gitignore` file (if not already added), since these files should not be version controlled

- Adds an `emulate` target to the Nx-firebase app, which is used by `serve` but also allows Firebase emulators to be started independently of a watched build.

**Plugin maintenance**

- Executors use workspace logger routines instead of console
- Fixed minor issues in e2e tests
- Removed redundant/legacy firebase target
- Replaced plugin use of node `join` with workspace `joinPathFragments`

**Migration from v0.3.2**

For users with existing nx-firebase applications in their workspace you may wish to add the new version schema updates manually to your workspace configuration files.

In your `angular.json` or `workspace.json` file, for each `nx-firebase` app project:

1. Add the `.runtimeconfig.json` to your build assets:

```
      "targets": {
        "build": {
          ...
          "options": {
            ...
            "assets": [
              ...
              "apps/nxfirebase-root-app/.runtimeconfig.json"
            ]
          }
        },
```

2. Add the new `emulate` target to your app:

```
      "targets": {
        ...
        "emulate": {
          "executor": "@nrwl/workspace:run-commands",
          "options": {
            "command": "firebase emulators:start --config firebase.nxfirebase-root-app.json"
          }
        },
```

3. Modify the `serve` target to:

```
      "targets": {
        ...
        "serve": {
          ...
          "options": {
            "commands": [
              {
                "command": "nx run <appname>:build --with-deps && nx run <appname>:build --watch"
              },
              {
                "command": "nx run <appname>:emulate"
              }
            ],
            "parallel": true
          }
        },
```

4. Add the new `getconfig` target:

```
      "targets": {
        ...
        "getconfig": {
          "executor": "@nrwl/workspace:run-commands",
          "options": {
            "command": "firebase functions:config:get --config firebase.<appname>.json > apps/<path-to-app>/.runtimeconfig.json"
          }
        },
        ...
```

And in your `firebase.<appname>.json` config settings for `"emulators"` add `"auth"` and `"pubsub"` configs:

```
    "emulators": {
        ...
        "auth": {
            "port": 9099
        },
        "pubsub": {
            "port": 8085
        }
    }
```

## v0.3.2 ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nx-v12.3.4-blue) ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node-v12-orange)


- Plugin now detects incompatible Nx library dependencies and aborts compilation when found

Incompatible dependencies are as follows:

1. Non `--buildable` libraries
2. Nested libraries that were not created with `--importPath`

If either of these two types of libraries are imported by Firebase functions, the compilation will be halted, since a functional app cannot be created with these types of dependencies.

See the [README](README.md#using-nx-libraries-within-nested-sub-directories) for more information.
 
## v0.3.1 ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nx-v12.3.4-blue) ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node-v12-orange)

- Removed undocumented/unusued `firebase` target in app generator. No longer needed.

- `serve` target now builds `--with-deps` before watching to ensure all dependent local libraries are built. Note that `serve` only detects incremental changes to the main application, and not dependent libraries as well at this time.

## v0.3.0 ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nx-v12.3.4-blue) ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node-v12-orange)

Project has been renamed from `@simondotm/nxfirebase` to `@simondotm/nx-firebase` to better match Nx plugin naming conventions. Took a deep breath and did it early before many installs occurred. Apologies to any users who this may have inconvenienced - I didn't realise I could deprecate packages until after I'd deleted & renamed the pnm project. Rest assured, I won't be making any further major modifications like this!

If you have already generated NxFirebase applications using `@simondotm/nxfirebase` you will need to migrate as follows:

1. `npm uninstall @simondotm/nxfirebase`
2. `npm install @simondotm/nx-firebase --save-dev`
3. Update the `builder` targets in any NxFirebase applications you already have in your `workspace.json` or `angular.json` config from `@simondotm/nxfirebase:build` to `@simondotm/nx-firebase:build`

## v0.2.3 ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nx-v12.3.4-blue) ![nx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node-v12-orange)

Built against Nx 12.3.4

**Updates**

- `build` executor now supports `--watch` option for incremental builds

- Added `serve` target to applications which will build the application with `--with-deps` and `--watch` options, and also launch the Firebase emulator with the application's firebase configuration in parallel

- Added `deploy` target to applications. Supports Nx forwarded command line arguments so commands like `nx deploy <appname> --only functions` work fine

- Default template function `index.ts` now has added import of `firebase-admin` to ensure all necessary Firebase package dependencies for functions are included out of the box

**Fixes**

- Default `firebase.appname.json` now has a valid default hosting configuration and apps ship with a template `public/index.html` (as generated by Firebase CLI) inside the application folder

- Nx-Firebase App generator sets `target` in `tsconfig.app.ts` to `es2018` to ensure Node 10 compatibility for Firebase Functions (for scenarios where root workspace `tsconfig.base.json` may be set to a later ES target)

- Fixed `predeploy` scripts in `firebase.appname.json` to use `npx nx` so that they work correctly in CI environments

- Fixed default `firestore.rules` file to correct a typo

- Fixed default `storage.rules` file to use version 2 ruleset

- Plugin peer dependencies set so there's some indication of plugin compatibility

**Migrating from apps generated with v0.2.2**

v0.2.3 adds these targets to your `workspace.json` or `angular.json`, so for users of earlier versions of the plugin this will have to be done manually:

```
                "serve": {
                    "builder": "@nrwl/workspace:run-commands",
                    "options": {
                        "commands": [
                            {
                                "command": "nx run <appname>:build --with-deps && nx run <appname>:build --watch"
                            },
                            {
                                "command": "firebase emulators:start --config firebase.<appname>.json"
                            }
                        ],
                        "parallel": true
                    }
                },
                "deploy": {
                    "builder": "@nrwl/workspace:run-commands",
                    "options": {
                        "command": "firebase deploy --config firebase.<appname>.json"
                    }
                },
```
