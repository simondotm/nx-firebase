## Nx-Firebase Functions

Since v2.x of the plugin, Nx-Firebase functions are now generated as individual applications, separately to the Nx-Firebase application.

### Generating a new function

Generate a new Firebase function using:

- **`nx g @simondotm/nx-firebase:function`**

OR 

- **`nx g @simondotm/nx-firebase:func`**

| Options | Type | Description |
|---|---|--|
| `name` | required | the project name for your function |
| `--app=<app-project-name>` | required | the firebase app this function will be a dependency of |
| `--directory=dir` | optional | the directory this function will be located in |
| `--format=<'cjs' or 'esm'>` | default 'esm' | specify if esbuild should generated commonJs or ES6 output |

### Firebase Function Projects

Firebase function application projects are buildable node Typescript applications, which are compiled and bundled using `esbuild`.

The entry point module for function projects is `src/main.ts`.

The default `main.ts` template is the same one generated by the Firebase CLI and defaults to using 2nd gen cloud functions. This file is of course just a starting point and can be modified as needed.

> Newly generated function projects may not deploy out-of-the-box. For some reason the default Firebase CLI template for `main.ts` does not include code to call `initalizeApp()` so this has been added as a comment to the nx-firebase plugin version of the template. **This call must be enabled in order to successfully deploy a function.**

### Building a firebase function

To build your firebase function use this command:

- **`nx build your-firebase-function-project-name`**

This will use `esbuild` to compile & bundle the input function Typescript source code to:

* `dist/apps/<function-project-name>/main.js` - The bundled function code, in a single ESM format output file
* `dist/apps/<function-project-name>/package.json` - The ESM format package file for firebase CLI to process and deploy


### Deploying a firebase function

To deploy your firebase function use this command:

- **`nx deploy your-firebase-function-name`**

Your function will be deployed by the Firebase CLI.

### Testing & Linting your firebase function

- **`nx test your-firebase-function-name`**
- **`nx lint your-firebase-function-name`**

### Bulk operations for functions

You can use the parent Firebase app to test, lint, build, watch and deploy all of your functions at once.

Note that there is no `serve` target for individual function projects, since serving only makes sense at a firebase app level with the Firebase Emulator suite, so use the following command instead:

- **`nx serve your-firebase-app-name`**

See [here](./nx-firebase-applications.md#nx-firebase-application-project-targets) for more details.

## Functions & Nx-Firebase Applications

### How Nx-Firebase function apps are linked to Nx-Firebase apps

The Nx-firebase plugin requires that Firebase function projects must always be a dependency of a single Firebase application project:

*  This approach allows for multiple firebase projects in a single Nx workspace
*  It ensures all functions can be [managed by the nx-firebase plugin](./nx-firebase-sync.md)
*  Function application projects are added as `implicitDependencies` to the parent Firebase application, which ensures we can test, lint, build & deploy all functions from the top level Firebase application
*  All functions share the same Firebase `--config` CLI option as the parent Firebase Application
*  All functions share the same Firebase `--project` CLI option as the parent Firebase Application
*  You can create as many Firebase function projects as you like
*  Firebase function apps can export either just one or multiple firebase cloud functions
*  When running the Firebase emulator using `serve`, **all** firebase function applications are built using `watch` mode, so local development is much more convenient


### Functions & Firebase Config

When new Firebase function applications are generated in the workspace:

* They are automatically added to the `functions[]` declaration in the project's `firebase.json` config file using the firebase CLI's `codebase` feature
* The `codebase` name assigned to the function in the config is the function applications project name. 
* When using firebase `deploy`, the CLI will deploy all `codebase`'s declared in the firebase config file




### Functions & ESBuild

`esbuild` is configured in the function's `project.json` to only bundle 'internal' source local to the workspace:
* Import paths using TS aliases to `@nx/js` libraries will be resolved as internal imports. 
* All external imports from `node_modules` will be added to the `package.json` as dependencies, since there is no good reason to bundle `node_modules` in node applications.

### Using ES Modules output

`esbuild` is also configured by default to always output bundled code as `esm` format modules:

* This ensures tree-shaking is activated in the bundling process
* Firebase functions with Node 16 or higher runtime all support ES modules
* The bundled output code in `dist` is _much_ cleaner to review
* We are only specifying that the _output_ bundle is `esm` format. The input source code sent to `esbuild` is Typescript code, which effectively uses ES6 module syntax anyway
* **Therefore, it is not necessary to change your workspace to use `esm` format modules to use this plugin since `esbuild` builds from Typescript _source code_, not compiled JS.**

### Using CommonJS output

If you still use Node `require()` in your Typescript function code, the default `esm` output setting for `esbuild` may not work. Your options are:
1. Refactor your code to use `import` instead of `require`
2. Modify the function `project.json` to set esbuild `format` to `['cjs']`
3. Generate your function applications with the `--format=cjs` option
  
Note that using `cjs` output may prevent tree-shaking optimizations.


### Why ESBuild?

While Webpack and Rollup are viable options for bundling node applications:
* `esbuild` is designed for node, 
* it is _very_ fast
* it optimizes the output using tree-shaking, which is great for fast cold starts
* and it works very simply out of the box with Nx without any need for additional configuration files.

If you want to try Webpack or Rollup, just change your `build` target in the function's `project.json` accordingly.

### Why not minify?

This plugin does not set or recommend the minify option for esbuild.

* It is not really necessary for cloud function node runtime environments
* Obfuscation of the code is not necessary since it executes in a private server-side environment
* There is minimal (if any) performance benefit to be had
* If exceptions occur in the cloud run, stack traces will be readable if code is not minified


## Node Runtimes for Firebase Functions

Firebase Functions are deployed by the Firebase CLI to specific Nodejs runtime environments.

The required runtime is automatically set by the nx-firebase plugin function generator, but can be manually changedt in the `firebase.json` configuration as a definition (eg. `nodejs16`, `nodejs18` etc.):

```
  "functions": [
    {
      "codebase": "firebase-project1",
      "runtime": "nodejs16",
      ...

    }    
  ],
```

Runtimes are recommended to be set to the same value for all functions in a project.
